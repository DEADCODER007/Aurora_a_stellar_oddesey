# Arora a stellar oddesey Q1

## Introduction
This project is a part of IIT Dh's Tech fest 'PARSEC'. This project is supposed to predict the solar radiation and goemagnetic storms in the near fututre if past data is given.<br>
We would aim only to provide the techincal details of the project in this README file and explain the scientific terms whenever necessary. If you want to know why we made certain assumptions,choices or 
if you want to have more details on the project please do check the project report.<br>
According to the problem statment of the project we were supposed to use DST values to predict the geomagnetic storm and well defined files with features and divisions(<i>train A,train B,train C</i>) were provided to do that.<br>

## Import of necessary modules and files
### We would need the following modules:<br>
1)pandas-for reading and working data frames.<br>
2)numpy-for the math required in data visualization and training.<br>
3)scikit learn-(sklearn.preprocessing and MinMaxScaler)for using scalers and trainging our model.<br>
4)keras- for training a neural network.<br>
5)tensorflow-to support keras in the backend and other uses in model training.<br>
6)matplotlib-for plotting graphs and other mathematical objects.<br>

### We need the following datasets
1)we need the feature files
